==========
Is a web based tool to create books. Users can add images, text, animations and publish to Internet, share with other users.

Technology used: 

- Backend: Asp.net MVC, Entity Frameworks, Ms Sql and Web api
- Frontend : AngularJs , Twitter bootstrap

A Database is being use to held user data but the heavy data for book material is store in XML files. I liketo use Linq for both Sql and Xml request. Communication between frontend (Angularjs) and backend (Web Api) is done via REst request (GET,POst) and Json is being used as data protocol in between them.

Check folder Fairytales/BookWriterTool/BookWriterTool/ for application structure.
